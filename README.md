# Lending Group Case Study

The Consumer Finance company is the largest online loan marketplace,
facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical
procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a
fast-online interface.

- Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss).
- If one can identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of default.
- Identification of such applicants’ using EDA is the aim of this case study.
